Uses reinforced learning to teach itself to play snake. I have a few ideas on how to get it to increase it's max score but for now it only uses the following states for learning:
    - Whether or not there's a body or wall in either direction
    - Which direction it's currently going
    - Where the next food item is

How to Run:
    - Run the SnakeAgent.py file and watch it train

Warning:
Human controls aren't disabled inorder to make debugging easier so you can play this as a regular game of snake if you only run SnakeAI.py


I played around a lot with the new match case statements in this project because I was excited for better switch statements, but this could all be rewritten using standard if/else statements.
